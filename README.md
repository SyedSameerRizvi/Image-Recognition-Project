# Image Recognition Project

   This project is all about teaching a computer to see! We'll use a cool library called Image AI to build a program that can figure out what's going on in a picture. Imagine showing it a photo of a fluffy cat, and it confidently declares, "That's a cat!" Pretty amazing, right?

Here's the plan:
  Training Champs: We'll feed the program a bunch of pictures that are already labeled, like "cat," "car," or "banana." By looking at these examples, the program will learn how to identify the key features that make each thing unique.

# Keeping Things Tidy: Virtual Environments
  Before we dive in, let's talk about keeping things organized. Imagine having a toolbox for each project you work on. That way, you know exactly which tools you're using and avoid any mess-ups. This is what virtual environments (venvs) do for your computer programs:
They prevent conflicts between the libraries you use for this project and those needed for other projects on your computer. They make sure you're using the exact versions of the tools (libraries) listed in a special file called "requirements.txt." This file is like a shopping list for your project, ensuring it has everything it needs.

# Creating a Virtual Environment:
  To create a virtual environment follow these steps from here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/

# Installing the Tools:
  Once your venv is ready, it's time to stock it up with the tools (libraries) from your shopping list ("requirements.txt"). You'll use a command called pip to do this. Again, this file tells the program exactly what it needs to get the job done.
You can install the file requirements.txt and then use the command pip install -r requirements.txt. Make sure the requirements file is in the same directory where your project or script will be.
